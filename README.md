# MSP-Sphero-Pilot--Urban-Wolf
Sphero loves to play keep-away! Play with your pet and friends, and chase Sphero as it moves in random directions and patterns!

Background"
For me, fetch gives my dog exercise.

Sure, I might have to chase her a little to get the ball back, but in terms of getting to play, there isn't much beyond throwing the ball for me. I do laugh when she does rush at top speed and miss picking it up with her mouth, yet always wonder how I can keep up her wolf-like hunting instinct in the comfort of the backyard.

"Urban Wolf" helps me achieve this, and more. It is a seemingly simple phone app where one button press starts Sphero rolling. Will it move left? Will it move right? Will it roll forward, stop, and roll back? We don't know. But it starts a free-for-all to catch Sphero before someone else does. It unlocks the wolf in our house dogs, and the wolf in ourselves.

This application has implicit exercise, but also helps keep agility and mental acuity in chasing the Sphero. Being unable to predict the Sphero's next move taps into primal instinct, and its small size also makes it a challenge for all beings to reach down and catch it before it rolls away.

So, #ImagineThis dream come true a month from today. This, a part of my #MSPLife, a part of the #MSPSpheroPilot. #Imagine a day where chasing a small, randomly-rolling ball gets you that much closer with your friends.

Updates and Notes:

Here is where I'll keep some updates on changes I am making on this project.
